   >>Limitations<<
    | There is a limit to how much we can write to the flash
    | memory since it degrades over time. It has a maximum
    | of 100,000 writes. This is something to consider for long-term.
    | usage.

   To write data to the flash memory:
   EEPROM.write(address, value)
   EEPROM.commit();

   To read data from the flash memory:
   EEPROM.read(address);

   ___________________________________________________________________

   This code reads and writes from the first address of the flash memory located 
   on the ESP32 board. It increments a value as fast as rw_delay lets it. 
   To change the rate of read/write, change rw_delay (in seconds).
